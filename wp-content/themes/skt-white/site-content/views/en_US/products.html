				<h2>Vanadium Alloy</h2>

				<p class="block-ellipsis">Vanadium with element symbol V and
					atomic number 23 is a silver-grey metal with good tractility and
					hardness, corrosion preventive, resistance to water, hydrochloric
					acid and sulfuric acid. Vanadium alloys include Ferro Vanadium,
					Vanadium Carbon Nitride . Its raw material are Pentoxide Fused
					Flakes V2O5 , V2O3 ..etc.</p>

				<h2>Titanium Alloy</h2>

				<p class="block-ellipsis">Titanium with element symbol Ti and
					atomic number is 22 is a silvery-white transition metal , Its main
					features are light in weight and high in strength, good corrosion
					resistance to sea water, aqua regia and chlorine..etc. Therefore it
					is know as “space metal “ for its thermo stability, low and high
					temperature resistance, acidproof, Alkali-resisting as well as
					other stable chemical properties.</p>

				<h2>Tungsten Alloy</h2>
				<p>Tungsten (Wolfram ) with element symbol W, Atomic number 74
					is an important alloying element in high-speed and other tool
					steels, and is used to a lesser extent in some stainless and
					structural steels. Ferro Tungsten is an alloying agent in steel
					making and it is also a remarkably robust alloy because of its high
					melting point. Wolfram has the second highest melting point after
					carbon.</p>

				<h2>Molybdenum Alloy</h2>
				<p>Molybdenum with element symbol Mo and atomic number 42 is a
					silvery white metal with hard and tough feature. Ferro Molybdenum
					is the main product of molybdenum alloy with 50%-60% Molybdenum.
					One of the primary benefits adding Ferro Molybdenum to an alloy is
					that it harden properties ,which makes steel extremely strong and
					at the same time weldable, Additionally, adding Ferro Molybdenum to
					an alloy can increase corrosion resistance. Therefore it is main
					agent to produce HSLA (High Strength-Low Alloy) steel and stainless
					Steel.</p>
